    "# Detecting patterns of speciation in the fos- sil record\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we use data from the NOW (New and Old Worlds) database of fossil mammals to study patterns of speciation over time and space. In particular, we are interested to know when and where speciation rates have been significantly high. The task is to find which time periods and which places over the history of mammals have given rise to exceptionally high numbers of new species. The phenomenon is known in the evolutionary literature as the “species factory”. Palaeontologists are interested why and in which ways those times and places are special. The role of computational science is to identify and characterize such times and places.\n",
    "We practice using pandas DataFrames, performing logistic regression and making statistical significance tests in data analysis."
